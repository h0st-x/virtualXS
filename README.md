## Installation:

-1- Import the RPM-GPG Key to your system:

```bash
rpm --import https://repo.virt-x.de/RPM-GPG-KEY-BitWorker
```

-2- Install the Virt-X Repository by adding the repo to your server:

```bash
dnf config-manager --add-repo https://repo.virt-x.de/virtx.repo
```

If the shell aborts with an error: No such command: config-manager. Install the core plugins:

```bash
dnf install dnf-plugins-core
```

-3- Now you can install "virtualXS" on your system:

```bash
dnf -y install virtualXS
```

That's it! After a successfull installation the script will take his place here: /opt/virtualXS.

```bash

That's it folks!
