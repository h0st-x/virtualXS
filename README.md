## Installation:

```bash
rpm --import https://repo.virt-x.de/RPM-GPG-KEY-BitWorker
```

-2- Install the Virt-X Repository by adding the repo to your server:

```bash
dnf config-manager --add-repo https://repo.virt-x.de/virtx.repo
```

If the shell aborts with an error: No such command: config-manager. Install the core plugins:
